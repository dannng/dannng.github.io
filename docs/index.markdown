## Mission
DANNNGâ€™s mission is to interrogate and demystify digital archival imaging, transfer, ingest, and packaging methods and make these concepts more accessible for the cultural heritage community.

## Background
Several of us started meeting, somewhat informally, with the original goal to investigate AFF4 as an alternative to capturing physical disk images. The conversation evolved over time, we invited more people that we personally knew to join the discussion.

We decided to put in a pitch for a presentation at the BitCurator Users Forum: when and how to create a disk image has always been something of a hot topic. AFF4 was a different perspective on this discussion that we thought would be valuable. As we started developing our proposal idea, what instead emerged were completely different documents. We found that our conversations instead kept coming back to developing something more like a decision tree that offered factors to consider when deciding how to transfer archival data from a donor to the archives.

So that's what we set out to write: a document that spotlights various considerations that archivists can use to determine whether it's most appropriate to create and retain a disk image. What we realized, as we were discussing one of the drafts of this document, was that we were in the process of developing a community resource without having consulted any members of the community outside of our small group. We also realized a larger problem: our group, which is composed of members from relatively well-resourced institutions, is not at all diverse.

So we decided to take a pause, at the draft we have now, and invite the community in to review, critique, and help develop this document into a true community resource, one that takes everyone into account, not just the handful of us who are in relatively well-resourced research libraries. We want everyone who sees themselves as part of this community to find something helpful and relevant to their work in this document.

Please, take a look and give us your honest feedback. What resonates with you? What isn't relevant? What have we missed? Is the way that we've framed this, as considerations to evaluate, particularly helpful for you, or is it not the way you think about this at all?

We also think a group that discusses issues related to disk imaging would be valuable to continue, and we can think of several additional projects we'd like to tackle after we complete the documents we started earlier. If this work interests you, please join these efforts. We recognize that any output this group produces will benefit greatly from a wider array of backgrounds and experiences.
