Digital Archival traNsfer, iNgest, and packagiNg Group

## Mission
DANNNG strives to demystify digital archival imaging, transfer, ingest, and packaging methods and make these concepts more accessible for the cultural heritage community. We focus on resources that help practitioners evaluate options and make informed decisions for their workflows. [Here is some](https://dannng.github.io/background.html) additional information on how we got started.

## Current Resources
Here are the resources we developed to help archivists and digital preservation practitioners evaluate workflow options.
