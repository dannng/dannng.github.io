## Mission
DANNNGâ€™s mission is to interrogate and demystify digital archival imaging, transfer, ingest, and packaging methods and make these concepts more accessible for the cultural heritage community. [Here is some more information on how we got started](https://dannng.github.io/background.html).


## DANNNG?
Digital Archival traNsfer, iNgest, and packagiNg Group


## Resources
Here are the resources we developed to help archivists and digital preservation practitioners evaluate workflow options, specifically regarding when and how to capture physical disk images.

- [Disk Imaging Decision Factors (version 1.0.1)](https://dannng.github.io/disk-imaging-decision-factors.html)
- [Digital Archives Technical Glossary (version 1.0.0)](https://dannng.github.io/digital-archives-technical-glossary)


## Resources in Progress
- Tool Guide


## Potential Future Projects

In addition to our resources in progress and further developing our existing resources, here is a short list of ideas that we are considering and exploring for future work.

- Disk Image Feature Matrix
- Imaging Field Guide
- Resources Covering Imaging
- IT Specs for your Org
- AFF4 Evaluation
- Imaging and Documenting Failed Media
